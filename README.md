# Model Rocket System
This repository contains all the files associated with the planning, design and implementation of a model rocket avionics system. 

## Hardware

### 3D Models
The folder contains the STL files for the various components that were modelled and printed for the rocket.
The parts included are:
- Gimbal
- Gimbal adaptor
- Nose cone
- Rocket body
- Rocket stand

### Avionics System
This contains the files and designs for the avionics system that will be onboard. This includes things such as the bill of materials, PCB schematics and the libraries used for the different boards.

### Base Station System
Contains the schematic and PCB layout used for the base station system. 

### Open Rocket Simulation
Contains the Open Rocket simulation for the designed rocket. In the files it contains the dimensions for the different components and weights. 

## Firmware

## Avionics System Firmware
This contains the code used for the avionics system. This includes things such as the libraries used for the different components,the test code for the different sensors and the source files for them.

### Base Station Firmware
This contains the code that will be used by the base station.

## Documentation

### Project Requirements
This contains documents which specify the requirements for the project as outlined by the stakeholder. This includes things such as the health and safety plan, lab safety plan and thorough definition of the project requirements. In the project requirement document it discusses the purpose and scope of the project, and what we planned to achieve before the end of the project.

### Architecture Design
This section contains a document which describes the architectural design of the rocket and the various systems. A proof of concept is developed using the considerations outlined in the project requirements.

### Retrospective Images
This contains the images from the retrospectives taken at the end of every sprint. In them they show what has been going well, what could be improved and other opinions of the team on this project.
