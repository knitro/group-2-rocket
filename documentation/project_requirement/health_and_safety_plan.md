# ENGR 301: Safety Plan Living Document

## Introduction:

The aim of this document is to layout the safety plan draft for the avionics system Group 2 will build. This will include listing the project requirements that create risk of bodily harm, and the plan to mitigate those risks.

This is to be adjusted according to changes in the working environment, as well as the wider society. Due to unsettling times resulting from COVID-19, health and safety should be of most concern, even if the situations that we may be in are constantly changing within both the context of the project, and our own personal lives. *See section 2 for more details.*

## 1. The Rocket:

As of this stage, the specific form of the rocket is undeterminable; however, general aspects that the rocket have been outlined, and safe procedures for those aspects determined.

The rocket will use either an electric or solid-fuel motor; in the case of the solid fuel motor, additional risks are presented. The solid fuel motor used, of which is limited to the C and D classifications, is obtained as a complete certified product by the given manufacturer. The motor will not be modified, or used, in any way other than that outlined by the manufacturer. The engine must never be exposed to any ignition source other than that of the launch platform, and for this case, only when carrying out the launch event. Only an electrical ignition system can be used for the ignition of the rocket, as per the NZ Rocketry Association's safety code for rockets utilizing class A-F motors.

The rocket's expected maximum altitude after launching has not yet been determined. The distance the rocket may drift after launch, due to wind, may resultantly not be determined. Regardless, an exclusion zone around the rocket launch site must be established before launching; only personnel directly tasked with the launch of the rocket may be permitted within this zone. Minimizing the risk to non-vital personnel is paramount.

The NZ Rocketry Association's safety code also states that materials used for exterior features of the rocket (nose, body, and fins) must be lightweight and non metal. This is to minimize potential injury in the event that the rocket falls, or otherwise collides, with a person.

## 2. COVID-19:

An issue that has arisen during the initialization of this project has been COVID-19. This situation is evolving as the newly introduced COVID-19 Alert System [1] forces changes upon the workflow on the project. To plan and comply with each alert system, the guidelines below must be followed by all team members on top of any requirements from the official alert system [1], and any other requirements listed in this document.

### 2.1. Alert Level 1:
*Prepare Stage: The disease is contained in New Zealand* 

* Any team member who feels unwell should stay home immediately, while contacting everyone else in the team to let them know. A time when they started to feel ill should be disclosed during this contact.
* When meeting in person, all team members must engage in physical distancing as per the recommended from the NZ Government.

### 2.2. Alert Level 2:
*Reduce Stage: The disease is contained, but the risk of community transmission remains*

* Everything from Alert Level 2 and..
* All launches must be performed where nobody else from the public is present.

### 2.3. Alert Level 3:
*Restrict Stage: High risk the disease is not contained*

* Everything from Alert Level 2 and below and ..
* All project work must be done online with no exceptions.
* All meetings must be performed online.
* Any launches are to be postponed until a lower alert level is reached. 

### 2.4. Alert Level 4:
*Lockdown Stage: Likely that disease is not contained*

* Everything from Alert Level 3 and below and ..
* Requirements and deadlines to be extended to assist in the mental health of all team members from the stress.

## 3. Launch Details:

An issue that has arisen during the initialization of this project has been COVID-19. This situation is evolving as the newly introduced COVID-19 Alert System [1] forces changes upon the workflow on the project. To plan and comply with each alert system, the guidelines below must be followed by all team members on top of any requirements from the official alert system [1], and any other requirements listed in this document.

### 3.1. Travel Plan:

To ensure the safe transportation of all team members and the rocket, the procedures listed must be followed:

**Team Members:** <br>
* A designated university staff member must be contacted prior to the travel, citing exact time, date and location of the launch, and the arrival time after the launch.
    * The contact details must be readily available for all team members.
* Time, date and the location of where we are going to launch must be written in the Mattermost for everyone to reference against.
* There must be an established meeting place for the situation where any member is lost. This location must be determined, and known to all members, prior to the rocket's launch.
    * This meeting place must have reception and/or internet connection that is accessible by all team members. This is to ensure everyone present is able to make contact with appropriate team members or university staff.
* Everyone must be able to contact each other through mobile means (such as text/messenger apps) in the case that a team member is missing.
    * If contact through these means is unavailable (such as lack of reception), then everyone must meet at the designated meeting place.
* In the event that it is unavailable to meet with or contact a team member, the designated university staff must be contacted to explain the situation.
* If the team members do not arrive at the specified time, the designated university staff must take emergency action.

**Rocket:** <br>
* The rocket must be transported, such that the engine is not ignited during transport.
    * [Engine specifications here with heat that the engine combusts, ways to mitigate this]
* The rocket must be transported, such that the rocket does not injure anyone through physical contact.
    * This is to be resolved through transporting the rocket such that the rocket should not be able to be moved while in transport.
    * [Add exact transportation implementation of the rocket here]

### 3.2. Environment:

All relevant regulations must be met to ensure that the rocket launch is as safe as possible for the team members, as well as the wider community and environment. These include the following:
* CAA 101.157 - The rocket shall not be launched given that there are clouds that cover more than half of the sky (See Appendix B)
* CAA 101.158 - The rocket should not be launched during the night (See Appendix C)

To ensure these regulations are met, the following assessment of the environment must be performed before launch:
* The rocket is to be only launched during the day, with more than half of the sky being visible, and not obstructed by clouds.
    * This is to ensure the rocket's location, regardless of GPS tracking, can be observed and followed during the entire rocket launching process.
* Check for any precipitation. The presence of any will lead to the cancellation of the launch. 
    * This is due to the possible case that the precipitation disallows the rocket to successfully launch, creating a situation where the rocket has not launched when expected.
* Wind speeds and gusts must be checked to not exceed ([some_value] km/h, [some_value] km/h). 
    * This is due to the possible case that the ignited rocket will spread the ignition flames to uncontrollable levels.
    * This is also to ensure that the rocket is still able to have a controlled ascent up, and descent down, without leaving the specified premises.

Wind Speeds, weather and precipitation chance data are all to be collected via the AccuWeather and MetService before launch day, and before launch. 
*  https://www.accuweather.com/
*  https://www.metservice.com/
If the weather does not permit and/or appear to not be permittable (such as high chance of precipitation) during any of these stages, the launch should be cancelled or postponed immediately.

To avoid any damage in the environment where the launch is taking place, it must be ensured that:
* The area is clear of anyone else other than team members and/or other supporting staff.
* The area around the rocket launching position must be clear of debris.
* The area that the launch of the rocket is taking place must be clear from any obstructions that may cause disruptions if interacted with, such as powerlines.
* Potential landing areas downwind from the launch site must be free of obstructions that could be damaged and/or interact with the rocket. The potential landing area must be calculated before each launch, taking into account dynamic factors such as wind speed, rocket motor burn time, expected altitude and other factors. The landing area will be extremely large so that safety is not at risk and the ability to recover the rocket is almost ensured.

If any of these conditions cannot be fully met, the launch must be postponed or cancelled entirely.

To ensure no member of the public walks in during the launch sequence, or during flight, there shall be 3-4 team members covering all possible entrances at the maximum distances into the launch site, advising and ensuring nobody enters until the launch has finished.
If anybody disregards these orders for any reason, the launch must be cancelled or postponed if the launch has not been performed yet.

### 3.3. Equipment

The following equipment is to be taken to the launch. These must all be checked off prior to, during, and after being at the launch site. This is to ensure all items are accounted for, and that any dangerous or safety related equipment for other teams are still available for use, and aren't left as a risk to the general public.

### 3.4. Supervision

All launches will be supervised by the client. The client for this design and is a member of the NZ Model Rocketry Association.
The client will be responsible for approving the launch and launching the rocket, no one else may launch the rocket. All motors and propellant will be transported to and from the launch site by the client. The rocket will be launched from a launch pad and rail provided by the client.

### 3.5. Launch

The launch of the rocket poses multiple risks to team members, and members of the general public; minimizing these risks is paramount.

In accordance with the NZ Rocketry Association, individuals are free to launch rockets using class A to D motors, provided they have the permission of the owner of the launch site. No greater authority needs to be informed of the rocket's launch.

The immediate launch site must be safe from hazards before a launch may be prepared; this includes direct (e.g. sharp objects) and indirect (e.g. flammable materials) hazards that may harm team members. In these conditions, members of the general public should not be present; however, these hazards should be considered as potential risks for the general public as well.

Solid fuel motors pose the greatest risk at launch; flammable debris, such as dry grass, may ignite as a result of the motor's burn. The immediate area within 3m of the launch pad must be clear of any flammable materials. If this is not achievable, a fire resistant deflection material may be place immediately underneath the launch pad. All personnel must wear suitable PPE in preparation for the launch; namely safety glasses.

Personnel related to the rocket launch should be clear of the rocket at the time of launch. When the area is deemed clear of hazards, and all personnel safely distanced from rocket, a countdown will commence to make all personnel aware of the eminent launch. This countdown will provide a generous, and safe amount of time for all personnel; any member of the team may cancel the launch at any point during the countdown, at which point the safety interlocks will be re-enabled.

In the event of a misfire, launch pad safety interlocks must be enabled. The rocket is not to be approached for at least 60 seconds, at which point only the client may approach the launch pad for inspection.

### 3.6. Unforeseen Events

#### 3.6.1 Members of the Public

To ensure the safety of the members of the public, the following must be performed:
* Any member of the public entering the premises of the launch must be stopped by a team member to the best of their ability. If the closest team member is unable to communicate with that member of the public under any circumstance, another team member must approach the given member of the public to discuss about the rocket launch, and inform them of the associated risks.
* If a member of the public would enter the premise of the launch site, the launch must be postponed until the member of the public leaves the premises.
* If a member of the public is unwilling to listen to the team member, the client must be contacted ASAP to discuss the situation with the member of the public.
* If, for any reason, a member of the public decides to not listen to the warnings and communications of the team members, either actively or inactively, the launch of the rocket must be postponed if possible, until the issue is resolved with the client and the member of the public.

#### 3.6.2 Faulty Components and Equipment

To ensure the safe launch of the rocket, the following procedures must take place if there appears to be faulty equipment:
* If the rocket is physically damaged/suspected to have sustained damage during transportation, the motor must be removed before being inspected.
    * If the rocket has sustained physical damage, it must be determined if the rocket is still safe to launch or not. If the rocket can not be suitably repaired in-the-field, such that it could perform identically to how it would have prior to the damage, the launching of the rocket must be postponed until proper repairs have been completed.
    * If any electronics are broken alongside the physical body of the rocket, then the launch is to be postponed until the fix can be made.
    * If the fix cannot be made to either the physical rocket or the electronics, the launch is to be cancelled until further notice.
* If anything corresponding to the launch is faulty (such as failure of motor ignition or lack of combustion), all members near the launch must promptly relocate to a designated protected area, wait a minimum of 2 minutes, and then allow the client to approach and assess the situation.

## 3.7 Lab Risks:

When constructing the rocket in the lab, there are several important risks to account for.

* When working on computers for coding, regular breaks must be taken to reduce the chances of repetitive strain injury (RSI) and any strains to the eyes.
* When creating the rocket, the working area must be clean. This means that:
    * The floors must be clean such that cables and wires do not trip anyone up.
    * Furthermore, there should not be any sharp objects on the ground in case anyone does trip.
    * There must be sufficient air flow when soldering, such as a room air conditioning and a small fan at the soldering station.
    * Contact to wall outlets/230VAC supply should never be made under any circumstances; connections to these outlets should never be exposed.
    * The maximum voltage of any circuit, under prototyping conditions or other, should never exceed 60V.
